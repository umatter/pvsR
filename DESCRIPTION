Description: Facilitates data retrieval from Project
    Vote Smart's rich online data base on US politics via the Project Vote
    Smart application programming interface (PVS API). The functions in this
    package cover most PVS API classes and methods and return the
    requested data in a data frame.

Note: In order to use this package you need your personal Project Vote
    Smart API key. To get an API-key you need to sign up for access
    to PVS' API (see http://votesmart.org/share/api for details).
    Whenever you are using pvsR make sure that your personal PVS
    API key is saved as an option (options("pvs.key" = "yourkey")) or in 
    the variable pvs.key (pvs.key <- "yourkey"). If there is no valid PVS 
    API key saved as an option or in the variable pvs.key the functions in 
    this package won't work.
