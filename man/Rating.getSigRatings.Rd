\description{
This function is a wrapper for the Rating.getSigRatings() method of the PVS API Rating class which dumps all ratings (scorecards) by a special interest group. The function sends a request with this method to the PVS API for all candidate and SIG IDs given as a function input, extracts the XML values from the returned XML file(s) and returns them arranged in one data frame.
}

\dontrun{pvs.key <- "yourkey"}
# get ratings of certain special interest groups
\dontrun{rating <- Rating.getSigRatings(list(568,1120,1704))}
\dontrun{rating}
