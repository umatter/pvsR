# First, make sure your personal PVS API key is saved as an option
# (options("pvs.key" = "yourkey")) or in the pvs.key variable:
\dontrun{pvs.key <- "yourkey"}
# get all officials of a certain state
\dontrun{bill <- Votes.getBill("17623", separate=c("actions", "sponsors"))}
\dontrun{actionids <- bill$actions$actionId}
# get all votes on this acti
