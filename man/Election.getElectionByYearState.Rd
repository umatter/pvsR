\description{
This function is a wrapper for the Election.getElectionByYearState() method of the PVS API Election class which grabs district basic election data. The function sends a request with this method to the PVS API for all state IDs and years given as a function input, extracts the XML values from the returned XML file(s) and returns them arranged in one data frame.
}
\examples{
# First, make sure your personal PVS API key is saved as an option
# (options("pvs.key" = "yourkey")) or in the pvs.key variable:
\dontrun{pvs.key <- "yourkey"}
# get information about an election of a certain year and state 
\dontrun{election <- Election.getElectionByYearState(list("NY","FL"),2012)}
\dontrun{election}
