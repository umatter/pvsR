\description{
This function is a wrapper for the Measure.getMeasuresByYearState() method of the PVS API Measure class which grabs a list of state ballot measures in a given year. The function sends a request with this method to the PVS API for all years and state IDs given as a function input, extracts the XML values from the returned XML file(s) and returns them arranged in one data frame.
}
\examples{
# First, make sure your personal PVS API key is saved as an option
# (options("pvs.key" = "yourkey")) or in the pvs.key variable:
\dontrun{pvs.key <- "yourkey"}
# get a list of ballot measures for a certain state and year
\dontrun{measures <- Measure.getMeasuresByYearState(list(2010,2012),"FL")}
\dontrun{measures}
