\description{
This function is a wrapper for the Rating.getRating() method of the PVS API Rating class which dumps all candidate ratings from a scorecard by a special interest group (SIG). The function sends a request with this method to the PVS API for all rating IDs given as a function input, extracts the XML values from the returned XML file(s) and returns them arranged in one data frame.
}
\examples{
# First, make sure your personal PVS API key is saved as an option
# (options("pvs.key" = "yourkey")) or in the pvs.key variable:
\dontrun{pvs.key <- "yourkey"}
# get the candidate rating by a certain special interest group
\dontrun{scorecard <- Rating.getRating(77)}
\dontrun{scorecard}
