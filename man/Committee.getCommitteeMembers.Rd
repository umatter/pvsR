\description{
This function is a wrapper for the Committee.getCommitteeMembers() method of the PVS API Committee class which returns a list of members of a committee. The function sends a request with this method to the PVS API for all committee IDs given as a function input, extracts the XML values from the returned XML file(s) and returns them arranged in one data frame.
}
\examples{
# First, make sure your personal PVS API key is saved as an option
# (options("pvs.key" = "yourkey")) or in the pvs.key variable:
\dontrun{pvs.key <- "yourkey"}
# get a list of members of certain committees
\dontrun{comember <- Committee.getCommitteeMembers(1)}
\dontrun{comember}
}
