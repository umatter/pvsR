\description{
This function is a wrapper for the Election.getStageCandidates() method of the PVS API Election class which grabs district basic election data according to the election and stage ID. The function sends a request with this method to the PVS API for all election and stage IDs given as a function input, extracts the XML values from the returned XML file(s) and returns them arranged in one data frame.
}
\examples{
# First, make sure your personal PVS API key is saved as an option
# (options("pvs.key" = "yourkey")) or in the pvs.key variable:
\dontrun{pvs.key <- "yourkey"}
# get election data for certain election IDs
\dontrun{election <- Election.getStageCandidates(stageId=list("P"),electionId=list(2582,2607))}
\dontrun{election}
}
