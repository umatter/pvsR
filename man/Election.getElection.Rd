\description{
This function is a wrapper for the Election.getElection() method of the PVS API Election class which grabs district basic election data according to the election ID. The function sends a request with this method to the PVS API for all election IDs given as a function input, extracts the XML values from the returned XML file(s) and returns them arranged in one data frame.
}
\examples{
# First, make sure your personal PVS API key is saved as an option
# (options("pvs.key" = "yourkey")) or in the pvs.key variable:
\dontrun{pvs.key <- "yourkey"}
# get data of a certain election
\dontrun{election <- Election.getElection(as.list(2595:2607))}
\dontrun{election}
}
